<h1>Hey, well done!</h1>

<p>You've successfully completed BADGE BOOTCAMP. A hearty congratulations from the team. But soft, what bullet points do through yonder webpage break?</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>You should totally issue some badges. They make excellent Christmas presents, and you don't have to wrap them!</li>
<li>Send some warm fuzzies to the team. Include a gif, though, or we may never read your email. We're like that.</li>
<li>Tell anyone and everyone about this course. Hey, it's free. Why wouldn't you?</li>
<li>Sign up for one of our workshops</li>
<li>Refuse to be told what to do by a set of bullet points, and do your own thing. Whatevs.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Catch ya later, alligator,</p>

<p>The We Are Open Co-op crack squad of badge bootcampers</p>
